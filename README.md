# Installation
Requirements:
- lucid version >=0.2.3

Need to restart runtime after installation. 

# Running the Code

To run the examples you first need to download the 3D mesh object as well as the associated texture image from the input folder

Detailed instructions for running the code are provided in the C414Project.ipynb notebook. Rendering the new stylized tetxure images takes around 10 minutes. 

The style transfer models and images we used in the report will be located in the folder titled inputs.
